    * - the proposal then gets stored on the blockchain by the `eosio.msig` contract, and is accessible for review and approval to those accounts required to approve it,
    * - after each of the appointed accounts required to approve the proposed transactions reviews and approves it, you can execute the proposed transaction. The `eosio.msig` contract will execute it automatically, but not before validating that the transaction has not expired, it is not cancelled, and it has been signed by all the permissions in the initial proposal's required permission list.
